abstract = {Agrometeorological information, used for decision making, represents part of a continuum; at the other end is scientific knowledge and understanding. Other components of this continuum are the collection of data and transforming data into useful information. Information has value when it is disseminated in such a way that the end-users get the maximum benefit in applying its content. This paper explores the potential of the new information and communications technologies to improve the access to agrometeorological information. The Internet will play an important role in the collection and transfer of information. In developing countries, Multi-Purpose Community Telecentres (MCTs) will be the equivalent of an information supermarket. Radio can be used to transfer information from MCTs to rural areas. Using response farming as an example, a prototype information system that can have wide applicability is suggested. Procedures on evaluating the impact of agrometeorological information are provided. Future concerns about the information needs of diverse end-users, information on a fee basis, and the training needs of end-users and intermediaries are discussed. Although modern technology has improved agrometeorological information and increased the number of end-users, continued improvements are necessary to ensure that the content of the information is adequate to fulfill the requirements of the farming communities.}
